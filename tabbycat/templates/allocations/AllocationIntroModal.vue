              <p class="mt-4">
                The allocation interface has a lot of features, so its worth providing a quick
                overview of how it works. This modal will only show once; but if you ever want to
                review it you can change the <em>show allocation introduction</em> under the
                <em>UI Options</em> section of this tournament's configuration.</p>
              <p>
                Use the buttons at the bottom left to view the different stages of the workflow.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-priorities" role="tabpanel">
              <h2>Assigning Priorities</h2>
              <p>
                Debates with higher 'priority' values are given a higher-strength panels when
                adjudicators are automatically assigned (as described in the next step).
                You can use the <strong class="text-success">Auto-Prioritise</strong> button to
                have Tabbycat automatically assign relative importances (based on either a room's
                bracket or 'liveness'). With either option the highest priority value is not used
                so that it is available as an override.</p>
              <p>
                You can of course skip this step only only ever assign priorities manually, or use
                the automatic assignment just as a first pass. Note that priorities are relative;
                no absolute: if half the debates are set to "5" and the rest to "1" it would be the
                same as if they were set to "4" and "2" respectively.</p>
              <p>
                A debate's priority can be manually set using a slider. It looks like this:
              </p>
              <input max="2" min="-2" step="1" type="range" class="mb-4 mt-3 mx-5">
              <p>
                Even if using the auto-prioritise feature it is generally a good idea to check over
                each debate's priority and check for any edge cases that mean it should have a
                lower or higher value.
              </p>

            <div class="tab-pane fade" id="pills-allocating" role="tabpanel">
              <h2>Allocating Adjudicators</h2>
              <p class="mt-4">
                You can use the <strong class="text-success">Auto-Allocate</strong>
                button to have Tabbycat automatically create panels for all debates.</p>
              <p>
                Whether you used auto-allocate or not, adjudicators can be dragged and dropped
                between debates to create or modify form panels. Whenever an adjudicator is added
                or removed from a panel the change will be saved automatically.</p>
              <p>
                Note that grey area at the bottom of the screen serves as an 'unused' area.
                Adjudicators in here will not show up in the resulting allocation; however it can
                also be handy to use as a staging area for adjudicators that you want to
                assign later on.

                There are a series of buttons in the top-right that can be used to turn on or

                such as this:

                These toggles are typically use near the end of an allocation to check for obvious
                disparities in gender, regional, or judge ranking balance across debates. Because
                that they can obscure the colors used to identify conflicts, it's worth turning
                them off before doing a final check of the allocation.

                'Sharding' allows you to split up the allocation interface into smaller
                sub-sections that only contain a portion of the entire draw. This can be used to
                essentially distribute the task of allocating adjudicators across multiple computers
                without worrying about each person overwriting the other's changes.</p>

                <strong class="text-danger">Important Note:</strong> this feature is in beta, and
                its use requires clear communication amongst those using it. You need everyone to
                be absolutely clear how the draw is being divided (i.e. <em>thirds</em> by
                <em>bracket</em> using <em>top-to-bottom</em>) and be sure that only one person is
                ever viewing each subset. If multiple people are viewing the same subset, or one
                person is still changing the entire draw you may end up overwriting each other's
                changes without realising it.

              <p class="mt-4">
                When viewing a shard note the unallocated adjudicator panel will be hidden and the
                Auto-Prioritise and Auto-Allocate options will be disabled. You should ensure
                adjudicators have already been allocated, or remember to view the entire draw
                afterwards to allocate the remaining adjudicators. Once you have finishing
                allocating using shards be sure to check the main draw page and ensure that there
                have are no double-allocations, empty panels, unnoticed conflicts etc.
