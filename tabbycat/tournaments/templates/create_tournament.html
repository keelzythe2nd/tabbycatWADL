    Tabbycat is free to use for non-profit and non-fundraising tournaments
    (although donations are encouraged). If your tournament is run for profit
    or for fundraising, please note that there is a
    <a href="{{ donations_url }}">required payment</a>. For more details, see the <a href="http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/about/licence.html">

        If you're learning or playing around with Tabbycat, it's easiest to
        create a demo tournament that is prepopulated with a fake (but typical)
        set of teams, adjudicators, venues, and the like. You can then delete
        this demo tournament later on, or deploy a new instance for your real
        tournament.
